// to submit this when finished, post an issue on the GameOfWar repository
// with a link to your repository on GitHub(not GitHub Enterprise)

// Tasks: 
// - Your game should run without errors
// - The game starts immediately when the JavaScript is executed. 
// - Create your two players and start the rounds!
// - There is no user input. The program simply loops through rounds until the game is finished.
// - Print a message for each round showing the cards played by each user,
//   who won the round, and how many cards each player has.
// - Include a README written in well-formatted Markdown (hint: look up README templates)
// - Show a good commit history with frequent commits (We're looking for lots of small commits!)

// Hints
// - Adding a property for the "value" of a rank could make it easier to compare face cards
//   (ie: Jack < Queen).For example, 2 - 10 will represent each number 
//   and then 11, 12, 13, 14 for J Q K A, respectively.
// - It could be helpful to have a class to represent the overall Game,
//   particularly when handling ties and other complicated game states.
// - Write Pseudocode! Break the project down into different components. 
//   What are the pieces to this problem ? Solve them each individually and build 
//   towards a solution for the overall problem.Teach each piece individually before moving on!
// - Make it work, make it good, make it fast.This is a common developer axiom. 
//   It means: focus first on making something work
//   (even if it isn't well written or it's buggy).
//   Then, turn to making it work well.Then, and only then, start to worry about 
//   other things like performance.
